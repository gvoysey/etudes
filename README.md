# Etudes
>Etude, n.     a short musical composition, typically for one instrument, designed as an exercise to improve the technique or demonstrate the skill of the player.Origin mid 19th century: from French, literally ‘study.’

These etudes are small self-contained re-implementations of classic problems and algorithms.

They're probably not the best code in the world, but the point is to learn new things by reinventing wheels, not to make a good wheel.
